# NFL-ETL
## Extraction 
  We will extract data from Kaggle on the NFL draft to determine the draft position (round and overall position) for all quarterbacks since   2004 We will also extract data from Kaggle on NFL quarterback performance statistics for the last 15 years  
## Transform 
  We will take averages of the statistical performance data to come up with summary passing stats for each quarterback We will combine the   data from each of our sources into a useable format  
## Load
  We will load the transformed data into either a relational or non-relational database. Time permitting we will create a Flask app with a   link to a JSON-ified version of our transformed data
